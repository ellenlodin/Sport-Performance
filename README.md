# The Relationship Between Internal Load and Sport Performance Outcomes

This project was carried out as part of the course Hardware Architecture for Embedded and Edge AI at Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

It explores how internal load and wellness metrics relate to match performance in professional volleyball players. Using machine learning on training load, jump, and wellness data, some predictive signals were found, especially from workload ratios and recovery scores. However, overall accuracy was low, highlighting the complexity of performance modeling and the need for richer, more individualized data.
